## Pre-requisites

### - `HTML` basics

## Your Job
Starting from the `ChadsList` directory, you will find a pre-coded static page of a table of Chad, and a form to add one to the list. Your job is to make that form work, using vanilla Javascript. Add yourself (if you're a chad) and some other chads you know. Here is an example of how it should be :

> ### ⚠️ NOTE ⚠️
> You should not touch any of the HTML or CSS. You're only allowed to edit the `script.js` file.

### Make it work
In order to see your changes directly in the browser without refreshing the page, after installing the `Live server` extention, you will need to navigate to the `index.html` file the click the `Go live` button at the bottom of VS Code, same as what is shown in the extention page [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
